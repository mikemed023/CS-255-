Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client of the DriverPass project was a student driver training company that wanted and online system that will help student drivers have a better success rate when going for the license test at the DMV. The online system should be accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, and only users with a valid account would have access to it.

What did you do particularly well?

One thing I did particularly well was gathering and analyzing the system requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would definitely would revise all the uml diagrams. I struggled mainly because I was not comfortable using lucid chart. In order to improve them I must watch 
as many tutorial as I can.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I thought of each individual user's role and then I decided what type of needs they had. Based on these needs I created several use cases to that would 
satisfy each user's need.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The first step is to gather all the requirements by interviewing the client preferably. Once requirements are gathered is time to analyze them. Several models are then created to describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. These can be refined after consulting with the client and getting their feedback.I wish to use software that can facilitate or even automate some of this process.
